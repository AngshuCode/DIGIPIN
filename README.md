# Digital Postal Index Number (DIGIPIN) CLI Tool

## üöÄ Introduction

This repository contains a Python Command Line Interface (CLI) tool for working with the Digital Postal Index Number (DIGIPIN), a standardized, geo-coded addressing system initiative by the Department of Posts, Government of India.

The DIGIPIN system divides India's geographical territory into uniform 4-meter by 4-meter (approx.) units, each assigned a unique 10-digit alphanumeric code derived from its latitude and longitude coordinates. This tool allows you to:

- **Encode** geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) into a DIGIPIN
- **Decode** a DIGIPIN back into its central latitude and longitude

## üôè Credits

This implementation is based on the technical specifications and logic outlined in the **Digital Postal Index Number (DIGIPIN) - National Level Addressing Grid (Technical Document ‚Äì Final version)** released by the Ministry of Communications, Department of Posts, Government of India.

The original DIGIPIN initiative was undertaken by the Department of Posts in collaboration with **IIT Hyderabad** and **NRSC, ISRO**. Full credit for the design and concept of DIGIPIN goes to these esteemed organizations.

## ü§ñ AI Assistance

This specific some code and README.md file were generated with the assistance of an AI. 

## ‚ú® Features

- **encode**: Convert latitude and longitude coordinates into a DIGIPIN code
- **decode**: Convert a DIGIPIN code back into its approximate central latitude and longitude
- **Validation**: Includes basic validation for input coordinates and DIGIPIN formats

## üíª Installation

1. Clone this repository (or simply download the `digipin_cli.py` file):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AngshuCode/DIGIPIN.git
cd DIGIPIN
```


2. No external Python libraries are strictly required beyond standard built-in modules (`math`, `argparse`). Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

## üöÄ Usage

You can run the `digipin_cli.py` script directly from your terminal.

### Getting Help

To see the available commands and options:

```bash
python digipin_cli.py --help
```

For help on specific commands:

```bash
python digipin_cli.py encode --help
python digipin_cli.py decode --help
```

### Encoding Coordinates to DIGIPIN

Use the `encode` command followed by the latitude and longitude.

**Example:** Encoding coordinates for Dak Bhawan (28.622788¬∞N, 77.213033¬∞E)

```bash
python digipin_cli.py encode 28.622788 77.213033
```

**Output:**
```
DIGIPIN: 39J-49L-L8T4
```

### Decoding a DIGIPIN to Coordinates

Use the `decode` command followed by the DIGIPIN code. You can use the code with or without hyphens.

**Example:** Decoding the DIGIPIN for Dak Bhawan

```bash
python digipin_cli.py decode 39J-49L-L8T4
```

**Output:**
```
Latitude: 28.622788
Longitude: 77.213033
```

Alternatively, without hyphens:

```bash
python digipin_cli.py decode 39J49LL8T4
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Core Logic)

The core logic within `digipin_cli.py` directly translates the encoding and decoding algorithms defined in the official DIGIPIN technical document, including:

- **Bounding Box**: The geographical extent of India (Longitude 63.5¬∞ ‚Äì 99.5¬∞ East, Latitude 2.5¬∞ ‚Äì 38.5¬∞ North)
- **Hierarchical Grid**: Dividing the area into 16 (4x4) regions at each of 10 levels
- **Alphanumeric Symbols**: Using the specified 16 characters (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, C, J, K, L, M, P, F, T) for encoding
- **Spiral Labeling**: The specific anti-clockwise spiraling pattern for assigning symbols within each 4x4 grid
- **Coordinate-to-Code Mapping**: Precise calculations to map latitude and longitude to the correct grid cell at each level
- **Code-to-Coordinate Mapping**: Reverse calculations to determine the central point of a given DIGIPIN's cell

## üß™ Testing

To test the tool with known coordinates:

```bash
# Test encoding
python digipin_cli.py encode 28.622788 77.213033

# Test decoding
python digipin_cli.py decode 39J-49L-L8T4
```
